title: "Western diplomats are careful to predict when Iran’s leader might fall"
summary: "Western diplomats are now very cautious about saying whether Iran’s Supreme Leader could be ousted, remembering how they misread the Shah’s fall in 1979. Current protests show no clear cracks inside the government or mass defections from the military. While the regime is still united, economic problems and protests could eventually force change, but experts say it’s too early to tell."
