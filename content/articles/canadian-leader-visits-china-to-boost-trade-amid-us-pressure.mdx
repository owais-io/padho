title: Canadian leader visits China to boost trade amid US pressure
summary: >-
  Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney, is heading to Beijing to try and
  rebuild ties with China after years of trade friction and political disputes.
  With the US imposing tariffs and a “America First” policy, Canada wants to
  find new markets, especially for oil, coal, timber and food. The visit could
  ease Chinese duties on Canadian goods, but there are worries about human
  rights, election meddling and security. Carney hopes to keep China out of
  sensitive tech while opening business doors.
