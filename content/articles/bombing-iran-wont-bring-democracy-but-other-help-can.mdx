title: "Bombing Iran won’t bring democracy, but other help can"
summary: "Trump’s first use of the huge “Moab” bomb in Afghanistan showed he likes to make bold attacks, but it didn’t defeat the enemy or change the war. He now threatens to bomb Iran, but such strikes would harm ordinary people and not force democracy. Instead, the article says the US should use sanctions, cut ties, and help Iranian civil groups grow. Real change must come from inside Iran, not a gun."
