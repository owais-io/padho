title: "Hizb ut‑Tahrir Australia Won’t Shut Down Before New Hate‑Speech Bill"
summary: "Australia is pushing a hate‑speech law that could label groups like Hizb ut‑Tahrir and the neo‑Nazi National Socialist Network as hate groups. The bill would lower the bar for banning, making it a crime to support such groups and allowing up to 15 years in prison. Hizb ut‑Tahrir says it will stay active until the law passes, while the NSN has already announced it will disband. The government says the law is solid but may face court challenges."
