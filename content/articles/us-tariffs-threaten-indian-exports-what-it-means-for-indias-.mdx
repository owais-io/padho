The US has slapped a hefty 50% tariff on most Indian exports, part of President Trump's move to penalize India for continuing its oil purchases from Russia. This situation poses a significant challenge for the Indian economy, as the US is India's largest export market, contributing $86.5 billion annually. With approximately two-thirds of Indian shipments to the US now under this high tariff, sectors like textiles, jewellery, seafood, and leather are likely to be hit hard, potentially threatening jobs and economic growth. The tariffs could lead to a 43% fall in overall exports to the US, placing India at a competitive disadvantage compared to countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh. Although India's major sectors, such as generic pharmaceuticals and electronics, are exempt, the tariff burden could erase up to one percentage point from India’s GDP growth this year. Moreover, the job market, already facing a 5.6% unemployment rate, could see further setbacks. 

Despite the challenges, India continues to view Russia as a crucial ally for energy and defense, with Russian oil filling 40% of its needs. The government remains steadfast in securing energy deals that serve national interests, even if it means facing US tariff pressures. To counteract the economic impact, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urges a focus on domestically made goods and plans to implement tax reforms to boost spending. Additionally, a package to support exporters and market diversification efforts is underway, including a recent trade deal with the UK. However, experts warn that more comprehensive measures are necessary to prevent shutdowns and unemployment. There is also a cautious reopening to Chinese investments, with Modi attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit to navigate these economic tensions.
