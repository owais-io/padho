title: "India’s Free Health Scheme Is Struggling – Why"
summary: "India’s free health scheme, launched in 2018, helps millions get treatment without paying. But hospitals face huge delays paying bills, with unpaid claims over 1 trillion rupees. Paperwork and fraud slow reimbursement, causing cash problems. Some hospitals even stop treating scheme patients, leaving patients to pay out of pocket. The scheme still works for many patients, but the government must pay on time to keep it alive."
