title: "England coach says keep Archer for the third India Test"
summary: "England coach Paul Farbrace says he wouldn't pick Jofra Archer for the second Test against India because Archer has only 18 overs of red‑ball experience. He wants Archer saved for the third Test and prefers Chris Woakes at Edgbaston, who knows the pitch. Archer just returned to county cricket and bowled well, but his workload must be managed. Farbrace also noted media confusion over Archer’s squad spot."
