title: "Iran’s central bank is using large amounts of Farage‑promoted cryptocurrency"
summary: "Elliptic, a crypto‑tracking firm, found about $507 million worth of Tether, a dollar‑linked stablecoin, moving through accounts that look like they belong to Iran’s central bank. The move could help the country dodge global banking restrictions and support its currency. Nigel Farage, who has praised Tether, is hoping to push the token in the UK, but Tether says it follows sanctions and has frozen many illicit accounts."
