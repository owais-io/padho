title: "Iran cracks down on protests – what next for opposition?"
summary: "Iran’s military and police have used extreme force to stop street protests, leaving thousands dead and many more arrested. The government’s promises of reform have vanished, showing that the ruling elite can’t control the security forces. Inside and abroad, opposition groups are split – some still hope foreign leaders like Trump or Israel will help, while others blame them for false promises. A key figure is ex‑shah Reza Pahlavi, who urges a return to monarchy but lacks clear plans."
