title: Young lawyer takes Pakistan to court over “period tax”
summary: >-
  A 25‑year‑old lawyer from Rawalpindi, Mahnoor Omer, has taken Pakistan’s
  government to court over the high taxes on sanitary pads, calling it a “period
  tax.” The extra 40 % duty makes pads unaffordable, especially for poor girls
  who miss school and risk infections. Omer’s case, supported by the youth group
  Mahwari Justice, seeks to lower the cost and stop the stigma around
  menstruation.
