title: China urges European countries to ban Taiwanese politicians
summary: >-
  China sent diplomatic notes to several European governments, saying their
  border laws require them to refuse entry to Taiwanese politicians. Beijing
  warned that allowing such visits would hurt EU‑China relations and that
  Taiwan’s officials had “trampled on China’s red line.” European countries said
  visa rules are set by their own laws, not China, and that Taiwan’s trips were
  unrelated to China. Taiwan’s foreign ministry condemned the pressure, while
  experts see it as part of Beijing’s effort to isolate Taipei.
