title: An Italian chemical factory’s toxic legacy moves to India
summary: >-
  In 2018 the Italian factory Miteni was shut after it leaked forever chemicals
  called PFAS into the water of 350,000 people. Its equipment and patents were
  sold to an Indian company, Laxmi Organic, and now a new plant in Lote,
  Maharashtra is making the same chemicals again. The plant uses Italian
  technology, and local villages complain the waste‑water system isn’t working.
  India has no strict rules for PFAS, so the risk to residents and workers is
  still a big worry.
