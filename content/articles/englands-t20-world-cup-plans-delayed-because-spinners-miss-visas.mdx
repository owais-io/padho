title: "England’s T20 World Cup plans delayed because spinners miss visas"
summary: "England’s T20 Cup plans are in trouble because the Indian government has not yet granted visas to spinners Adil Rashid and Rehan Ahmed. Both players, born in Pakistan, are unlikely to join the squad for the six warm‑up matches against Sri Lanka this weekend. The delay adds pressure on England, who lost the Ashes and are already under scrutiny after captain Harry Brook was fined for an altercation. The ECB hopes visas will arrive in time for the Cup."
