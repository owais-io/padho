title: Police raid activist’s home over fossil‑fuel campaign
summary: >-
  Indian police raided the home of environmental activist Harjeet Singh, who
  co‑founds Satat Sampada, after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said he
  accepted nearly £500,000 in foreign money to push a
  fossil‑fuel‑non‑proliferation treaty. The ED says the money could hurt India’s
  energy security and could face legal challenges. Singh was briefly detained
  but later released on bail. He says the charges are false and politically
  driven, and India’s climate NGOs are facing heavy pressure.
