title: "Trump says U.S. will act if Iran executes protesters"
summary: "Donald Trump said the U.S. would take “very strong action” if Iran begins executing protestors amid a death toll that has risen to more than 2,500. He warned the regime before he met with officials, noting that thousands are already jailed and at least one young protester faces execution. Iran’s crackdown, which shut down the internet and has drawn travel warnings, has sparked criticism from human‑rights groups. Trump’s threat echoes past U.S. pressure, but the effect is unclear."
