title: Trump asks EU to slap India and China with high tariffs to pressure Russia
summary: >-
  Trump told EU officials he wants them to slap India and China with up to 100%
  tariffs. He says this will help pressure Russia to end the Ukraine war.
  Trump’s request came after talks in Washington and after Russia’s recent drone
  attacks. The move follows U.S. tariffs on Indian goods and Mexico’s new car
  tariffs. Legal battles over Trump’s tariffs mean the plan could change if
  courts rule them illegal.
