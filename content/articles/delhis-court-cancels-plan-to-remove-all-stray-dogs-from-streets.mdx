summary: "India’s top court rolled back a plan that would have taken every stray dog in Delhi to shelters after they were spayed or neutered. The new ruling says dogs should be sterilised, vaccinated and dewormed, then let back into their neighbourhoods, keeping only aggressive or rabid ones in care. The court also wants safe feeding spots for the dogs. Many people support the move, while some worry about how to run the new system."
