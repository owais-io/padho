title: "China’s population shrinks again, birth rate hits record low"
summary: "China’s population fell again in 2025, the fourth year in a row, because the birth rate plunged 17% to just 7.9 million births. The total population dropped to 1.405 billion while deaths rose to 11.3 million. Beijing has tried to help by offering a childcare subsidy and covering childbirth costs, but many young people say kids are too expensive and jobs are scarce. The ageing population and past one‑child policy mean fewer people of child‑bearing age."
