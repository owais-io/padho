title: "Umar Khalid Has Been in Jail for Five Years Without a Trial"
summary: "Umar Khalid has spent five years in an Indian jail without a trial. He was arrested in 2020 under a terrorism law after he spoke out against the government’s citizenship law and the 2020 Delhi riots. His bail has been denied by courts, and the evidence against him is weak. Human rights groups say his detention is unfair and a warning to Muslim activists. Khalid, a left‑wing activist, remains in Tihar jail, reads books, and talks with family."
