title: "Trump pulls back on Chagos Islands deal because the UK won’t allow US use of its base for strikes on Iran"
summary: "Donald Trump recently said he would stop backing the Chagos Islands deal after the UK refused to let the U.S. use the island’s Diego Garcia airbase for a possible strike on Iran. He linked the deal to U.S. military plans, which the UK says would violate international law. The move could delay the bill, and the UK government and politicians are trying to keep the agreement alive while the U.S. reconsidered its position."
