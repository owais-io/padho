title: "Iran is in a big crisis. People in many cities are shouting at the government. The protests started because the money they use – the rial – fell a lot and food got very expensive."
summary: "The Iranian police and the army have been very harsh. Many people have been shot. Human‑rights groups say hundreds have died and many more have been arrested. The internet in Iran is shut down for over a day. This makes it hard for people to share news. Some say the blackout helps the government control the story, but others say it keeps people from learning what really happened. The U.S. president, Donald Trump, has said he is thinking about military action. He says he will help protesters if the Iranian army kills them. Some think this could make the situation worse. Other countries, like China and Russia, want peace. They say no one should use force. Iran’s foreign minister says the country is ready to talk if the talks are fair. He also said the internet might be back soon. In short: big protests, harsh crackdown, many deaths, a long internet cut‑off, and a U.S. threat to intervene. The world is watching, hoping the violence stops and talks can happen."
