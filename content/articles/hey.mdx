title: "Hey!"
summary: "It’s the last day of the England‑India Test at the Oval.   England need about 320 runs to win. India only need a few wickets to level the series.   The first session went well for England – a big start and a good partnership.   India’s bowlers, especially Mohammed Siraj, have been on fire, so England are under pressure.   If England hit the target before lunch, they’ll win. If they collapse, it could be a draw or India could take it close to the end.   So it’s a classic “everything depends on today” day.   If you’re going to the ground, bring a friend, enjoy the cricket, and watch the game at 11 a.m.   Good luck!"
