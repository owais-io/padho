summary: >-
  Supreme Court ordered Delhi officials to round up thousands of stray dogs,
  sterilise, vaccinate and move them to new shelters. Authorities have eight

  The goal is to cut dog attacks and reduce rabies deaths, which claim thousands
  of lives each year. Some residents and animal‑rights groups say the plan is
  cruel, costly and impossible, and they protested the ruling.
