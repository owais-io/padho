title: "India’s Modi says he’ll pay a heavy price to fight US tariffs"
summary: "US President Donald Trump added a 25% tariff on Indian goods to punish India for buying Russian oil. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he will pay a heavy price for standing up to the U.S. He’s especially firm on protecting farmers and refusing to import genetically‑modified crops, saying it’s non‑negotiable. The 50% tariff threat could hurt Indian textiles, cars, and steel. India may need to cut its own tariffs to stay competitive."
