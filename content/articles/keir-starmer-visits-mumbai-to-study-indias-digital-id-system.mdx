summary: "UK leader Keir Starmer flew to Mumbai to look at India’s Aadhaar digital ID system. He said it had helped cut paperwork and save money, but it also raised privacy worries and hurt some minorities. Starmer hopes the UK could create its own voluntary ID system for schools, mortgages and licences, while making a mandatory ID for jobs to stop illegal work. He met Indian officials and talked about using the experience to build an inclusive, secure scheme."
