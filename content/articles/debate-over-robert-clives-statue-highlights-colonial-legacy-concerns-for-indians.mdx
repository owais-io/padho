A statue of Robert Clive, known as Clive of India, located outside the Foreign Office in London, has drawn criticism for its presence due to Clive's controversial legacy in India. Labour peer Thangam Debbonaire expressed concerns about Indian dignitaries and citizens having to encounter the statue, which represents a figure associated with colonial exploitation. In Shrewsbury, residents share similar concerns about a statue of Clive in their town. A petition demanding its removal garnered 9,000 signatures, yet the local council decided to keep the statue, adding only a small interpretation board after three years. The dissatisfaction among Shrewsbury's residents reflects a broader discomfort with celebrating colonial figures, particularly from the Indian perspective, where Clive is viewed as an 'unstable sociopath,' a term used by historian William Dalrymple. The conversation around these statues is significant for Indians, as it highlights the enduring impact of colonial history and the ongoing efforts to reconcile with the past. For Indian visitors and dignitaries, encountering such statues can be a stark reminder of the colonial era's injustices, urging a re-evaluation of how history is commemorated. The debate not only affects how history is acknowledged in Britain but also influences India's cultural and historical narratives, encouraging a more nuanced understanding of the colonial impact.
