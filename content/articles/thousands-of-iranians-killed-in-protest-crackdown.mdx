title: "Thousands of Iranians Killed in Protest Crackdown"
summary: "Iranians are fighting for better lives, but the government has shot down the streets. Roughly 2,000 to 12,000 people may have died as police used guns and pellet rounds. The protests happened in every part of the country, from city centers to rural villages, as people demanded fair wages, free speech, and women’s rights. While the U.S. tweeted encouragement, no military help has come. With Iran’s internet shut down, the world’s attention is fading, leaving many victims unheard."
