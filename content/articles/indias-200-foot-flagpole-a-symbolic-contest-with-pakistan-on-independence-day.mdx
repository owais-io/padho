At a remote border checkpoint between India and Pakistan, Indian soldiers are set to mark Independence Day by raising the national flag on a towering mast that stands taller than the Pakistani flag across the frontier. This act is part of an ongoing 'flag warfare' between the two countries that involves building taller flagpoles as a symbol of national pride. The latest site of this flagpole competition is Sadqi, located in Punjab's Fazilka district, where India's tricolour will fly from a 200-foot mast, overshadowing Pakistan's 165-foot flagpole at Sulemanki. 

Rahul Bedi, an Indian military expert, notes that while this contest might seem symbolic, it is loaded with emotional and nationalist overtones, especially given the fraught relations between the two nations. The rivalry is not new, as India and Pakistan have had a long history of conflicts, including four wars and numerous skirmishes since their independence. This flagpole contest is another facet of their complex relationship, reflecting the deep-seated nationalism on both sides. 

The practice of flag-lowering ceremonies happens each evening along the heavily militarised Punjab border. These events, including the famous ceremony at the Attari-Wagah crossing, are both military drills and nationalist spectacles. The Attari-Wagah ceremony started in 1959, and over the years, it has become a grand display of choreographed patriotism, with spectators cheering for their respective countries. 

The flagpole rivalry at Attari-Wagah began in earnest in recent years, with India and Pakistan continuously trying to outdo each other by erecting taller poles. In 2017, India raised a 360-foot pole, which Pakistan countered with a 400-foot mast. India responded with a 418-foot pole, leading to a somewhat humorous 'arms race' in flagpole heights. This rivalry has also led to other developments, such as Pakistan planning a large stadium and theme park near its border ceremony site. 

Despite the spectacle and show of patriotism, the large flags often succumb to the border's harsh winds, leading both countries to fly smaller flags on most days. On Independence Day, however, Sadqi will see a large tricolour unfurled, highlighting the ongoing symbolic contest. This flagpole rivalry underscores the enduring tensions and competition between India and Pakistan, adding a unique dimension to their historical and political relations.
