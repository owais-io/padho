title: Trump’s Military Options Against Iran Are Very Limited
summary: >-
  Trump talks about using force on Iran, but the U.S. actually has few real
  choices. There are no aircraft carriers in the region, and any air attacks
  would need to use bases in other Middle‑East countries, which could get
  counter‑attacks. Even bombing the Iranian leader would be hard, illegal, and
  likely not stop the regime. Cyber hacks and other tactics might be tried, but
  they’re not proven solutions.
