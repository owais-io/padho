title: "Our Family Planted a Garden While Gaza Was Bombed"
summary: "During the Israeli bombing of Gaza, a family of four decided to plant a small garden as a quiet protest. They bought seeds, hauled water from far away, and tended to the plants even while bombs fell. The garden gave them food and a sense of hope. After fleeing, they came back to find the garden still growing. It shows how people keep life alive even in war."
