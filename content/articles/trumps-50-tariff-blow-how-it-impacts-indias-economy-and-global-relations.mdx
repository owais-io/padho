Donald Trump's decision to impose 50% tariffs on most US imports from India has marked a significant turn in the economic relations between the two nations. These tariffs, which aim to penalize India for its purchase of discounted Russian oil, have raised concerns about potential damage to the Indian economy and disruptions in global supply chains. Previously, the US had already imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods, but the latest escalation further intensifies the situation. The tariffs primarily target Indian exports worth $87.3 billion to the US, affecting sectors like textiles, gems, jewellery, and seafood, which are heavily dependent on the American market. However, some products, such as smartphones, are currently exempt.

The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has responded with a defiant stance, emphasizing the importance of buying local products and encouraging self-reliance. Modi's call for Indians to support 'made in India' goods reflects the broader strategy to mitigate the economic impact of the tariffs. Despite the pressure, India's external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, has criticized the US demand to stop buying Russian oil as unjust and hypocritical, pointing out Europe's extensive trade with Russia.

The tariffs have already had repercussions in India, with some manufacturers halting production due to increased cost pressures. This situation has rendered Indian goods less competitive compared to those from countries like China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Indian stock markets have also reacted negatively, with significant drops in indices. Economists warn that sustained tariffs at this level could lower India's GDP growth below the forecasted 6.5%.

The strained US-India relations reflect broader geopolitical dynamics, with India potentially strengthening ties with Russia and China. While trade talks between India and the US continue, there remains uncertainty about future relations. The Indian government is also exploring diplomatic avenues, with Modi planning visits to China and hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin later in the year. As India navigates these challenges, the focus remains on balancing international relations while safeguarding economic interests.
