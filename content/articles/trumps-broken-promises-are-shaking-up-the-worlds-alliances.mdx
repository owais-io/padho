summary: >-
  Trump’s broken promises are shaking up the world’s alliances. After Israel
  struck Qatar, Gulf leaders rushed to support each other, showing that old
  rivalries can be set aside. Meanwhile, India, China and Russia met in China to
  talk trade and security. Trump’s tariffs on India and China and his calls for
  other countries to punish them have made allies feel unsafe. Many nations are
  now looking for new partners and ways to protect themselves.
