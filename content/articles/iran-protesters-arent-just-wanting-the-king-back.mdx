title: "Iran Protesters Aren’t Just Wanting the King Back"
summary: "Iranians are walking the streets in big protests, but most of them aren’t simply demanding the old king back. They want an end to corruption, repression and high inflation, and they have no clear leader to replace the ruling clerics. Supporters of ex‑king Reza Pahlavi rally on TV, yet the U.S. and Trump stay cautious, worried about getting drawn into a civil war. Inside Iran, jailed activists and workers fear that the future is still uncertain."
