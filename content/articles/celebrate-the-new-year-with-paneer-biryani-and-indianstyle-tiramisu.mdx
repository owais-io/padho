title: Celebrate the New Year with Paneer Biryani and Indian‑Style Tiramisu
summary: >-
  After a busy year of excess, these recipes offer a fresh, spicy start to the
  new year. A vegetarian paneer biryani is made with small cheese‑and‑potato
  balls (koftas), fragrant spices, and a cool apple‑and‑raisin raita. Followed
  by a light, Indian‑twist tiramisu that swaps coffee for saffron‑infused milk
  and uses mascarpone, rosewater, and almond‑pistachio nuts. Easy to make and
  delicious for family and friends.
