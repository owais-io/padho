title: "Mumbai’s new motorway only serves the wealthy, critics say"
summary: "Mumbai’s new 8‑lane coastal motorway cuts through the city, built on land taken from the sea. While it shrinks travel time for car owners, most of the city’s 22.5 million residents still rely on crowded buses and trains. Critics argue the road was funded with taxpayers’ money that could have upgraded public transport. The project also destroyed mangroves, harmed Koli fishermen, and opened up new sites for luxury apartments for the wealthy."
