title: "Iran Won’t Sell Pure Uranium, Will Dilute It Instead"
summary: "Iran says it will not export its 300 kg of 60 % enriched uranium to other countries, but it will dilute the material to 20 % or less under UN inspectors. The move comes as the U.S. considers military options while negotiating with Tehran. Iran insists it will keep enriching inside its borders, and the U.S. is demanding zero enrichment. The offer could decide whether the U.S. will launch a strike. Meanwhile, student protests and a UN human‑rights meeting are happening."
