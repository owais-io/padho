title: Delhi tries cloud seeding to help clear its polluted air
summary: >-
  The Delhi government has launched its first cloud‑seeding test, dropping
  silver‑iodide particles into clouds with the hope of triggering rain and
  lowering the city’s dangerous air pollution levels. The first flight happened
  this week, and officials expect the first artificial rain by the end of
  October. Scientists warn the effect will likely be small, and it doesn’t fix
  the real pollution sources, like factories, traffic, and crop burning.
