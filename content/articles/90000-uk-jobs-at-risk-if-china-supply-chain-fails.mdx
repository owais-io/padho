title: "90,000 UK jobs at risk if China supply chain fails"
summary: "A UK think‑tank says that if China’s battery and solar supply chain stops, the country could lose up to 90,000 jobs and fail to make 580,000 electric cars. China controls most critical minerals, so a break would push the UK back to costly gas and cost the economy £1.5 billion a year. The report urges the government to boost UK battery and green‑steel production and partner with other countries to stockpile supplies."
