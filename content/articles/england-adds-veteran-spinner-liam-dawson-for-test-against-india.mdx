title: England adds veteran spinner Liam Dawson for Test against India
summary: >-
  England has added veteran spinner Liam Dawson to its squad for the fourth Test
  against India, ending an eight‑year absence from international cricket. He
  replaces Shoaib Bashir, who hurt his finger while fielding. Dawson’s county
  form has been spectacular – 49 wickets in 2023 and 54 in 2024 – and he’s also
  a solid batsman. Selector Luke Wright said the move is “well‑deserved” and
  that Dawson’s recent performances made the case.
