summary: >-
  Gambhir defended India’s choice to keep batting after England’s Ben Stokes
  offered to give up 15 overs. Stokes wanted to hand over wickets while Jadeja
  and Sundar were close to centuries. India stayed on, and Sundar scored his
  first Test hundred. Gambhir said the team had to try to save the series and
  let the batsmen finish. Stokes said he was tired but likely to play the final
  test.
