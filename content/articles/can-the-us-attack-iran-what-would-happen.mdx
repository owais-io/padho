title: "Can the U.S. Attack Iran? What Would Happen?"
summary: "The U.S. has moved a carrier, jets and missile‑defence systems close to Iran, ready for a possible strike. Analysts debate whether it could hit Iran’s leader or key sites, but any attack would almost certainly provoke a strong Iranian retaliation, including missile blasts and attacks on U.S. bases. Even if the leader were killed, the outcome for Iran’s policies is uncertain, and the move could spark wider war in the region."
