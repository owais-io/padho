title: "China Turns Rain Into Water for Buildings"
summary: "China’s big idea is to turn rain into useful water for buildings. The Bird’s Nest stadium in Beijing can collect and reuse half its water, using a special pipe system that channels rain into tanks for toilets, lawns, and cleaning. The city reuses about 30 % of its water, and other sites like DJI’s Shenzhen HQ also harvest rain. The government wants sponge cities to reuse 70 % of rain, and the industry is worth billions."
