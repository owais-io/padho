title: British families receive wrong bodies after Air India crash
summary: >-
  After the Air India flight crash, some British families were shocked to learn
  their loved ones' bodies had been misidentified. One family got a coffin with
  a stranger’s remains, another had mixed remains that needed sorting before
  burial. The problems were spotted when a London coroner checked DNA matches.
  The lawyer representing the families says the chain of custody was poor and is
  asking for answers. India says it followed protocols, but families are
  demanding full transparency.
