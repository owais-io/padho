title: "Iran’s protests crushed, people left silenced"
summary: "Late December, economic worries sparked protests that spread across Iran. The government reacted with force, killing many and using Iraqi militias to crush crowds. A monarchist leader named Reza Pahlavi pushed a “final battle” narrative, turning the protests into a nationalist struggle that ignored the country’s ethnic and gender diversity. Women, Kurds, and young people were left out, and the violence left many dead and the people’s demands unheard. Media focus is on two extreme stories, leaving real voices unseen."
