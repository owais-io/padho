summary: "India’s school lunch program is getting a wild makeover. In Meghalaya, teachers use local herbs, fish, berries, and wild greens in free meals for students. A charity called Nesfas trains cooks to grow food on school gardens and bring in fresh produce from nearby farms. Kids love the new dishes, and many stay healthier and more energetic. The project also helps local farmers and keeps meals cheaper and greener."
