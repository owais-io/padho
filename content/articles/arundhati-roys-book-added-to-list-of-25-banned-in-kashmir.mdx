title: Arundhati Roy’s book added to list of 25 banned in Kashmir
summary: >-
  The Indian government in Kashmir has banned 25 books, including Arundhati
  Roy’s Azadi. Authorities say the books spread a ‘false narrative’ and
  encourage secession. The order came from Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, who
  says the books could radicalise young people and glorify terrorism. Writers
  and scholars say the ban silences criticism and hides state violence. The move
  follows years of crack‑downs on dissent in the heavily militarised region.
