title: "Trump’s 50% tariff on India: What it means and how Delhi is responding"
summary: "Trump’s 50% tariff on most Indian goods has just taken effect in the U.S. after India kept buying discounted Russian oil. It will hit sectors such as textiles, jewellery, seafood and leather, cutting exports by up to 70 % and could shave a percentage point off India’s GDP this year. The government is urging people to buy home‑made products, lowering tax rates, easing loan costs and looking for new markets to cushion the blow."
