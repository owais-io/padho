title: "India Debates How to Count the Remote Sentinelese Tribe for 2027 Census"
summary: "India is preparing for its 2027 census, but officials aren’t sure how to count the Sentinelese, a tribe that lives on North Sentinel Island and rejects contact. A 5‑km exclusion zone protects them from disease and preserves their isolation. Past censuses only guessed the population from afar, with estimates ranging from 15 to 150. Experts warn that drones or satellites could be intrusive or frightening, so many argue the tribe should stay untouched."
