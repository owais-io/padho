summary: "In southern India, the Jenu Kuruba tribe has camped inside the Nagarhole tiger reserve to demand the right to live on land they were forced off in the 1980s.

The tribe’s legal fight under the Forest Rights Act failed, so they are now standing in the forest, demanding recognition and a return to their ancestral villages."
