India and China are showing positive signs in their often tense relationship, with both countries agreeing to resume trade and other ties. This development follows a meeting between India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi. They discussed ways to resolve the ongoing border dispute in the Himalayas, which has been a major point of conflict, especially since the deadly clashes in 2020. Modi emphasized mutual respect and the need to address each other's concerns, while China highlighted a path of steady development and mutual support. 

The discussions included resuming direct flights and issuing journalist visas, alongside business and cultural exchanges. This is a significant move as it indicates a thaw in relations after years of tension. Modi is expected to visit China soon to meet President Xi Jinping, marking his first trip there since 2018. The two countries have previously fortified their borders but are now working on agreements regarding border patrols and troop withdrawal.

India's Foreign Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval, also met with Wang to discuss boundary affairs. India raised concerns about China's proposed dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, fearing impacts on downstream communities. The meeting comes amid global shifts influenced by Donald Trump's trade policies, which have also affected India. Recently, Trump announced additional tariffs on Indian imports, which India deemed unfair. 

Moreover, India continues its strategic partnerships, notably with the US, through forums like the Quad, which counters China's influence in Asia. However, with the US imposing tariffs on India, the dynamics are complex. Russia remains a key partner, continuing oil supplies to India and proposing trilateral talks with China. Despite these global tensions, India's focus remains on managing its relationship with China while navigating its partnership with the US. After India, Wang Yi will visit Pakistan, further complicating regional dynamics as China maintains a close relationship with Pakistan, India's rival. 

Overall, while India and China's relationship is on a positive trajectory, there are still significant challenges to address, especially concerning security and regional influence.
