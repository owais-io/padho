title: "Adani Donated $600,000 to Queensland Party Before Election, Hidden Until 2026"
summary: "Adani, the mining company, gave Queensland’s Liberal National Party more than $600,000 before the 2024 state election. The money was split into big gifts that were not reported in Queensland’s real‑time disclosure system, so voters didn’t know about them. The donations were only shown to the federal electoral commission in February 2026. Critics say the company used a loophole to hide the cash and that corporate donations should be banned."
