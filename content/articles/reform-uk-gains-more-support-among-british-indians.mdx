title: Reform UK Gains More Support Among British Indians
summary: >-
  Reform UK’s backing among British Indians has jumped from 4% to 13% since the
  election, a survey by the 1928 Institute shows. The community, about 3 % of
  the UK, used to vote mainly Labour but is now moving right. Labour’s share
  fell to 35 %, Conservatives to 18 %, while the Greens have gained too. The
  shift comes as voters put the economy first, and Reform’s rise could change
  long‑standing voting habits.
