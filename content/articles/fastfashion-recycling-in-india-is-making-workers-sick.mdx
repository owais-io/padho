title: Fast‑fashion recycling in India is making workers sick
summary: >-
  Panipat, India, is the world’s biggest clothes‑recycling centre. Workers like
  27‑year‑old Neerma Devi cut and shred used garments into tiny lint that fills
  factory rooms. Breathing in this dust and tiny plastic fibres causes coughs,
  chest tightness and long‑term lung disease such as COPD. The factories also
  dump untreated dye‑water into nearby rivers, polluting groundwater and making
  locals sick. Despite health warnings and court orders, factories keep
  operating because people need the jobs.
