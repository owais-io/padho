title: "How a Video Helped Afghan Women Fight Taliban Crackdown"
summary: "Zarmina Paryani and other Afghan women marched in early 2022, burning a burqa to demand their rights. The Taliban responded with violence, even breaking into homes at night. When men raided Zarmina’s flat, her sister filmed a video that spread online and drew global attention. That footage helped the women escape. Today, women can hardly protest publicly; many live in exile, still fighting for their freedom."
