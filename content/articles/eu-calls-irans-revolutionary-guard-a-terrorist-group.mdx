title: "EU Calls Iran’s Revolutionary Guard a Terrorist Group"
summary: "The EU has officially labelled Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a terrorist organisation because of its brutal crackdown on protesters. This move follows years of debate and means the IRGC’s assets will be frozen and support to them becomes a crime. The EU also added more Iranian officials and companies to sanctions for human‑rights abuses. Iran’s foreign minister called the decision a mistake, while the EU says it will stop the regime’s violence."
