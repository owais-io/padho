title: "Trump’s Gaza Plan Challenges Extremists, Faces Immediate Tests"
summary: "Trump’s new “board of peace” announced a plan in Davos to rebuild Gaza as a unified Palestinian‑run territory, aiming to stop extremist calls for deportation and settlements. The blueprint includes restoring water, electricity and hospitals, opening the Rafah crossing, and creating a Palestinian police force that would disarm Hamas. Success depends on U.S. and Israeli cooperation, and on the board’s ability to enforce the plan. The first real test is the Rafah opening next week."
