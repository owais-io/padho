title: Pakistan to give free HPV shots to 13 million girls
summary: >-
  Pakistan is starting a national program to give one free dose of the
  Chinese-made HPV vaccine, Cecolin, to 13 million girls aged 9‑14 to protect
  them from cervical cancer. Health workers, mostly women, are talking to
  parents about the vaccine’s safety and how it won’t affect periods or
  fertility. The drive will reach girls who don’t attend school through
  community centers and will be part of the existing free immunisation scheme.
  The goal is to cut the country’s high cervical‑cancer death rate by 2030.
