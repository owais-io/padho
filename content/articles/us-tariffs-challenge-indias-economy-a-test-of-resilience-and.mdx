The recent imposition of a 50% tariff by the United States on most Indian imports marks a significant escalation in trade tensions. This move comes as a consequence of India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil, despite US pressure to cease these transactions. The tariffs, which are considerably higher than those on imports from other countries like China and South Korea, pose a substantial challenge to India's economy. The US is India's largest export market, and the increased tariffs threaten the competitiveness of Indian goods, potentially erasing up to one percentage point from India's GDP growth this fiscal year. Key sectors like textiles, jewellery, seafood, and leather will be hardest hit, possibly leading to significant job losses. Although India's pharmaceuticals, electronics, and petroleum products are exempt, the tariffs on other sectors could lead to a 43% decline in exports to the US. This development pressures India to find alternative markets and boost domestic consumption. The Indian government is responding by encouraging the purchase of locally made goods and planning tax reductions to increase domestic spending. Additionally, India is exploring free trade agreements with other countries to diversify its markets. Despite these challenges, India maintains its stance on purchasing Russian oil, which has saved the country billions. However, this strategy may face long-term sustainability issues if tariffs continue to impact Indian exporters. The government is also considering measures to support exporters, such as loan moratoriums and easing borrowing costs. As India navigates these economic challenges, it aims to strengthen its resilience and protect its national interests amid global trade pressures.
