title: UK and India Sign £4.8bn Trade Deal After Years of Negotiations
summary: >-
  Keir Starmer and Narendra Modi signed a £4.8 bn trade deal that will let UK
  and India trade cars, whisky, clothes and food more easily. The agreement ends
  three‑and‑a‑half years of talks and should help the UK economy after Brexit.
  India, with its high tariffs, will now face lower ones. Negotiators said
  building good personal relationships—like sharing yoga and tea—was key to
  closing the deal. It keeps immigration rules the same, giving just a few extra
  visas for chefs and yogis.
