summary: "Heavy rains in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province caused flash floods that have killed 700 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Residents like Bilawal Jamshed had to flee to rooftops as water rose in seconds. The floods also raised risks of water‑borne disease and left many families without clean water or medicine. The government blames illegal river‑side construction and poor planning, and vows to clean drainage and stop projects. Climate experts warn that deforestation and bad urban design worsen the damage."
