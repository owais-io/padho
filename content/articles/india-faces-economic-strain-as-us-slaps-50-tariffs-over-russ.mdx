The recent decision by Donald Trump to impose a 50% tariff on most US imports from India has created waves in the Indian economy. These tariffs, which came into effect at midnight in Washington, are in response to India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil, which the US argues indirectly funds Russiaâ€™s conflict in Ukraine. This move significantly impacts Indian exporters, who now face some of the highest duties imposed by the US, making Indian goods less competitive in the American market. Indian sectors like textiles, gems, and jewellery, which heavily rely on the US market, are seeing reduced demand, leading to halted production in areas like Tirupur, Delhi, and Surat. Despite this pressure, India remains defiant, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging the nation to support local products. This tariff increase could also strain India-US relations, historically built on strategic cooperation despite inherent distrust. While the US remains India's largest export market, the tariffs could push India to strengthen ties with Russia and China, as seen in recent diplomatic engagements. Indian officials argue against what they perceive as unfair treatment by the US, especially since Europe maintains significant trade with Russia. Although trade talks continue, the future of India-US relations seems uncertain, with trust being a major casualty in this tariff conflict.
