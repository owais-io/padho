title: "Iran is in the middle of a big problem right now."
summary: "**What’s happening in Iran?**   People in Iran are walking in the streets. They want more freedom. The government says it is fighting the protests. Many people were hurt. Some say dozens of protesters died. Hospitals are full of injured people. The internet is not working in Iran. That makes it hard to know the real numbers. **Why the United States is watching so closely**   The U.S. President, Donald Trump, says that if the Iranian government starts hanging or executing people, the United States will do “very strong action.” He has talked about military options, but he also wants the Iranian people to keep protesting. The U.S. government tells its citizens to leave Iran. It says it would be safest to go to Armenia or Turkey by land. **What Turkey is doing**   Turkey’s President is talking with Iran’s leaders. He wants to help calm the situation. Turkey has been very active. It calls for dialogue between Iran and the U.S. The Turkish President says Iran’s people should be able to talk and share information. He also says Turkey is ready to help if needed. **SpaceX is giving free internet**   Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX, has a satellite internet service called Starlink. The service is free for people in Iran. That means people can connect to the internet from their home. The government is blocking most of the internet, but the satellite can bypass that. **What is happening in the Middle East**   Other countries are involved too. Russia and France, for example, have said they are not happy with outside interference. They want the region to stay peaceful. The United Nations says the U.S. should not stir up violence. **What can you do**   If you are in Iran, the U.S. recommends you leave if it is safe. The U.S. also says you should find a way to talk without the U.S. government. If you are in the U.S., keep up with the news. The situation can change quickly. That’s the basic idea: Iran is having big protests. The U.S. and Turkey are watching closely. The U.S. warns about possible military action. Turkey is trying to help. The internet is blocked, but some people can use satellite. The situation is still evolving."
