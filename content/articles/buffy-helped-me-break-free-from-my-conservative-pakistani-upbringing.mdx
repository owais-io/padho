title: Buffy helped me break free from my conservative Pakistani upbringing
summary: >-
  At age ten, a shy Punjabi girl in Newcastle watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
  The show sparked a rebellion against her strict Pakistani family and the fear
  of violence. She embraced goth fashion, music, and feminism, finding courage
  when a family fight left her hurt. Inspired, she left the expectations of an
  arranged marriage, studied art, and now works as an artist. Buffy also helped
  her mother appreciate her new style.
