title: "London May Finally Approve China’s New Embassy After Years of Back‑and‑Forth"
summary: "Britain may finally green‑light a huge new Chinese embassy in London, a decision expected this week after a dispute that began in 2018. The site near the Royal Mint Court was bought for £255m but planning permission stalled, forcing China to use the embassy as leverage over other UK projects. Approval would ease tensions before the new prime minister’s visit, but MPs and local residents worry about security and protests. The move could also affect future trade deals."
