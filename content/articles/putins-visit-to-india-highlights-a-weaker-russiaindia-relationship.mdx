title: Putin’s Visit to India Highlights a Weaker Russia‑India Relationship
summary: >-
  Putin’s recent trip to India looked like a strong partnership, with a hug from
  Modi and promises of steady fuel supplies. In reality, India is buying less
  Russian oil and has made no big defence deals since Russia’s war in Ukraine.
  Both sides are now focusing on trade and other sectors for a 2030 partnership,
  but India is also deepening ties with the West and balancing its foreign
  policy.
