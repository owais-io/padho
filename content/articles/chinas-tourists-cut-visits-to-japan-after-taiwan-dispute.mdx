title: "China’s tourists cut visits to Japan after Taiwan dispute"
summary: "Chinese tourists have cut back on visits to Japan by almost half in December, after Tokyo’s prime minister warned of a possible military response if China invades Taiwan. The drop came as China urged its citizens to stay away, canceling cultural exchanges and films. Japan still attracted a record 42.7 million foreign visitors last year, but the tourism sector faces risk from the Taiwan‑China tension. Japanese officials hope Chinese travelers will return soon."
