title: "England’s Big Decision: Bringing Jofra Archer Back for the India Test"
summary: "England’s batting collapsed at Edgbaston, forcing a change for the next Test at Lord's. Selectors plan to bring Jofra Archer back after a long injury spell, hoping his swing will trouble India. It’s a gamble, as Archer isn’t fully fit, but the team can’t keep the same set. Alternatives include Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, or Josh Tongue, while the batting line‑up is also being examined. Some suggest adding 21‑year‑old Jacob Bethell to boost the top order."
