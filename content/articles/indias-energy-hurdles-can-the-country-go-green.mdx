title: "India’s Energy Hurdles: Can the Country Go Green?"
summary: "India is dealing with extreme heat, power cuts, and a big gap in reliable electricity. Most households struggle with energy poverty, and the country relies heavily on coal. While the government is building solar, wind, nuclear and green hydrogen, its climate plans are still seen as weak. India wants more help from richer nations and is pushing for climate finance at COP30. The challenge is to grow clean energy fast enough to keep the economy and people safe."
