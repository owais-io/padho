title: "Heatwaves and Heavy Rains Flood Pakistan’s Mountain Regions"
summary: "Record heat in Pakistan’s high‑altitude mountains has melted glaciers faster than before, while monsoon rains have swollen rivers. The result is flash floods and landslides that have killed at least 72 people and injured over 130. Temperatures reached a record 48.5 °C in Gilgit‑Baltistan, a place usually much cooler. Residents are being evacuated, roads are cut off, and many are losing power and water. Pakistan’s past floods in 2022 and its fragile climate situation add to the danger."
