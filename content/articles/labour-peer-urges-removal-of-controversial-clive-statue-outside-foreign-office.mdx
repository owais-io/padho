title: "Labour peer urges removal of controversial Clive statue outside Foreign Office"
summary: "Labour peer Thangam Debbonaire says a statue of British officer Robert Clive outside London’s Foreign Office should be removed because it glorifies a violent colonial ruler and makes Indian visitors feel uncomfortable. The statue, made in 1912, shows Clive in military dress and gives no context about his role in India’s exploitation. Debbonaire argues Britain should be honest about its colonial past and change how such figures are displayed."
