summary: "Since the war in Ukraine, India has become a top buyer of discounted Russian crude. The U.S. has slapped tariffs and sanctions on major Russian oil companies, cutting India’s imports by about a third. Russia is now using new suppliers to sidestep those rules. Most Indian refineries still buy Russian oil because of its low cost. The Kremlin says shipments will stay steady, while a big Indian firm, Reliance, has stopped buying Russian oil to avoid sanctions."
