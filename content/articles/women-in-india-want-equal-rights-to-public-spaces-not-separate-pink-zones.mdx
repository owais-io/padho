title: 'Women in India want equal rights to public spaces, not separate “pink” zones'
summary: >-
  During a Delhi photo shoot, a man asked intrusive questions, making the writer
  think about how India treats women as fragile. The country’s “pink” safe
  zones—pink carriages, buses, and toilets—only separate women from men, showing
  public spaces belong to men. Over half of Indian women rarely leave home, and
  crime data shows many women face violence. The piece urges treating women as
  equals, teaching respect, and giving them full access to public spaces.
