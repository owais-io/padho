title: 'Iran Protesters Need Our Help, Not More Western Intervention'
summary: >-
  Iran’s crackdown on protests has killed over 500 people and jailed more than
  10,000, according to human‑rights groups. Many Iranians are fed up with the
  theocratic government, its strict rules, and the economic hurt from sanctions.
  Western powers, especially the U.S., have a record of interfering in the
  Middle East—bombing Iraq, supporting Saudi Arabia, and threatening Iran—often
  making things worse. The article urges readers to back the Iranian people
  instead of supporting more foreign military action.
