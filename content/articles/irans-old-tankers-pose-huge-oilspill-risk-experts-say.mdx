title: "Iran’s Old Tankers Pose Huge Oil‑Spill Risk, Experts Say"
summary: "Iran’s shadow fleet of old, uninspected tankers is a looming danger for the seas, warns experts. Many vessels are more than 20 years old, some over 30, and they hide their true identities to dodge sanctions. A single spill could release more oil than the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster and cost a country up to $1.6 billion to clean. The report calls for better tracking and stricter port checks."
