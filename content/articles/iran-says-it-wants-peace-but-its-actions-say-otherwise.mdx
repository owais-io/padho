title: "Iran Says It Wants Peace, but Its Actions Say Otherwise"
summary: "Since 1979, Iran has treated the United States as an enemy, using violence and backing groups like Hezbollah, Hamas and Iraqi militias. U.S. courts say Iran’s Revolutionary Guard helped plan attacks that killed hundreds of Americans, from the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing to the 1996 Khobar Towers blast and many Iraqi soldiers in the 2000s. While Iran talks about peace, it still supplies weapons to these groups. Real peace would need Iran to stop backing terror and be honest its actions."
