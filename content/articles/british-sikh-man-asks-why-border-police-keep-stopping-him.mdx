summary: >-
  Gurpreet Singh Johal, a British Sikh and brother of Jagtar Singh Johal who is
  jailed in India, has written to the Home Office. He says border police have
  stopped him at airports several times, but have given no reason. He believes
  the stops may be linked to his fight to find out whether UK intelligence
  helped his brother’s arrest. His lawyers will argue in court that the
  intelligence share was unlawful and ask for an apology.
