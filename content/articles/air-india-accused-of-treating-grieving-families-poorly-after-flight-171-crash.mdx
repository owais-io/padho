title: Air India Accused of Treating Grieving Families Poorly After Flight 171 Crash
summary: >-
  A lawyer says Air India treated grieving families poorly after the Flight 171
  crash. Peter Neenan, who has handled big airline disaster cases, says families
  were forced to fill a complicated questionnaire in a hot, crowded room, and
  were warned that they wouldn’t get money unless they did. Air India says the
  forms are simple and needed for quick payments, and that it has already sent
  interim payouts to many families. Families say the forms are legal and cut
  compensation.
