title: Why Indian theaters are refusing Diljit Dosanjh's latest film
summary: >-
  Diljit Dosanjh is a huge Punjabi‑star who made a hit movie called Sardaar Ji
  3. The film was released abroad but won’t play in India because it stars a
  Pakistani actress. After an attack in Kashmir, India banned Pakistani content
  and the film crew asked the censor board to refuse a certificate. The movie is
  doing well overseas and many think it could have earned more in India. Critics
  say the ban is political censorship.
