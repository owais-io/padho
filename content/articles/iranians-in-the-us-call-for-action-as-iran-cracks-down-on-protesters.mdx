title: "Iranians in the US Call for Action as Iran Cracks Down on Protesters"
summary: "After months of protests, Iran’s government has started a violent crackdown that has killed many people. Iranians living in the US are terrified for their families back home, especially since the internet is blocked. They say quiet words and sanctions haven’t helped and urge the world—especially the United States—to step up, whether with stronger sanctions or, some argue, military help. Most want the regime to be stopped and civilians protected, but many fear the risks of foreign intervention."
