title: 'Aadhaar: India''s ID Card That Helps Some but Harms Others'
summary: >-
  Aadhaar, India’s huge digital ID, was launched 15 years ago and now people use
  it for everything – buying houses, opening bank accounts, getting jobs, and
  even voting. Many say it’s a huge help, cutting out paperwork and spotting
  fraud. But critics point out it leaves the poorest and illiterate people out,
  breaches privacy, and can even deny jobs or school places when their ID is
  lost or wrong. The system’s growth is seen as a win by the government, yet
  many feel it traps them in a web of constant ID checks.
