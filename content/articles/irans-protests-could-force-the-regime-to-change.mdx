title: Iran’s protests could force the regime to change
summary: >-
  In Iran, protests have spread to 180+ towns, with people shouting slogans
  against the supreme leader. The government shut down the internet and used
  force, with estimates of thousands killed and many arrested. While the regime
  may keep power, it will look very different—more brutal and isolated. Without
  reform, protests will keep happening, and the country may become even more
  repressive.
