title: "I’ve Paid a Heavy Price for Speaking Up in Iran – We Need Global Support"
summary: "I was jailed for eight years in Iran’s Evin prison because I spoke out against abuses. Today, protests are erupting again, led by women demanding an end to poverty, corruption, and repression. The government is shooting at crowds, killing over 2,000, and arresting thousands. Internet has been cut, and families can’t communicate. I urge the world to keep the pressure on, demand releases, and end torture."
