title: China and India Cut Coal Power Use for First Time Since 1970s
summary: >-
  Last year China and India cut coal‑powered electricity for the first time in
  over 50 years. China’s coal output fell 1.6%, India’s 3%, thanks to record
  build‑ups of solar and wind. China added 300 GW of solar and 100 GW of wind,
  while India added 35 GW solar, 6 GW wind and 3.5 GW hydro. Clean energy growth
  now drives more than 40 % of India’s coal decline, a milestone that could curb
  global emissions.
