title: "China’s Tech Enables Iran’s Internet Censorship"
summary: "China’s technology powers Iran’s strict internet controls, says a UK rights group. The report says Iran bought facial‑recognition cameras used on Uyghurs and a Chinese GPS system called BeiDou. Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese firms supplied tools that let Iran block sites, spy on traffic and shut the whole country offline during January protests. The blackout hid mass killings and still leaves people with patchy access. It shows how China helps other regimes keep the web under tight rule."
