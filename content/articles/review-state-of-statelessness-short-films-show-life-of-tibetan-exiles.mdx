summary: >-
  A group of short films called 'State of Statelessness' shows life for Tibetans
  living abroad. The stories follow families dealing with separation and
  migration. In some scenes the Dalai Lama appears in old photos, reminding
  viewers of Tibet’s uncertain future. One film follows a Tibetan husband in
  Vietnam who is happy but nostalgic, while another shows a Tibetan artist in
  Dharamshala whose marriage has broken after a tragic loss. The movies paint a
  sad, emotional picture of exile.
