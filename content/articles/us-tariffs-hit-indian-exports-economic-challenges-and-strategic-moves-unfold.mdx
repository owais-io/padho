The recent tariff hike by the US on imports from India has stirred significant concerns for the Indian economy. The US President, Donald Trump, has implemented a 50% tariff on most Indian goods, marking a severe response to India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. This tariff, which doubles an earlier 25% levy, has been justified by Washington as a consequence of India's refusal to cease buying Russian crude and defense hardware. For India, the US represents its largest export market, valued at $86.5 billion annually. This abrupt tariff increase threatens to cut deeply into this figure, potentially reducing India’s GDP growth by up to one percentage point this fiscal year. 

The impact is expected to be profound across several sectors, particularly those reliant on US demand. Textiles, jewelry, seafood, and leather industries are particularly vulnerable, with potential export reductions of up to 70%. This could lead to decreased job opportunities in a country where unemployment rates are already concerning. Conversely, India's pharmaceuticals, electronics, and petroleum products are exempt from the new tariffs, providing some relief. 

India’s strategic purchase of Russian oil, which currently accounts for 40% of its needs, stems from both economic and geopolitical considerations. Despite narrowing discounts on Russian crude, India continues its purchases due to the relative affordability and reliability. This decision aligns with India's broader strategy to maintain energy security and leverage its economic ties with Russia, especially amid the volatile global oil market. 

In response to the US tariffs, the Indian government is focusing on boosting domestic consumption and supporting exporters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has encouraged Indians to buy domestically produced goods and plans to adjust the goods and services tax to stimulate spending. Additionally, India is exploring new markets and recently signed a free trade agreement with the UK. Yet, many exporters still seek further government support to navigate the challenges posed by the tariffs. 

India is also making cautious diplomatic moves, including re-engaging with China, in a bid to counterbalance the US tariffs. As the government navigates this complex situation, India's commitment to protecting its economic interests remains firm. The situation underscores the broader global economic shifts, where nations are increasingly prioritizing their own interests.
