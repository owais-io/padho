  Australia’s withdrawal from Afghan cricket hurts refugees – there’s a better
  way
summary: >-
  In the summer after Kabul fell, Afghan refugees in Brisbane found comfort
  watching Rashid Khan play cricket on TV. Australia has stopped scheduling
  games with Afghanistan because of the Taliban’s ban on women, but this
  punishes Afghan male players who have no control over the regime. The writer
  argues that instead of silence, Australia could use its influence to support
  Afghan women cricketers in exile and keep Afghan men on the field, showing
  solidarity without legitimising the Taliban.
