title: Pant’s safe batting backfires; India’s defensive plan fails
summary: >-
  In a recent Test at Edgbaston, India’s star batter Rishabh Pant kept his shots
  very safe. He hit only one four and one six, and the crowd booed his blocks.
  He was eventually caught, showing the plan didn’t work. India has shifted to a
  defensive style, leaving out key bowlers and adding all‑rounders. The new
  approach feels wrong for the match and the team’s needs.
