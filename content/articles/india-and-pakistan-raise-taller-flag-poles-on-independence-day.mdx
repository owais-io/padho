title: "India and Pakistan raise taller flag poles on Independence Day"
summary: "India and Pakistan have once again turned their Independence Day into a flag‑pole showdown. Indian soldiers raise a 200‑foot tricolour on Sadqi, just above a 165‑foot Pakistani flag on the other side of the border. The rivalry started after a brief 4‑day war three months ago, and the flag‑pole battle is a symbolic way the two nuclear‑armed neighbours show patriotism and keep their tensions in the spotlight."
