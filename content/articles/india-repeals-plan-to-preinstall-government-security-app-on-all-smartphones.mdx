title: "India Repeals Plan to Preinstall Government Security App on All Smartphones"
summary: "India’s telecom ministry has cancelled a recent order that would have forced every phone sold in the country to come with a government‑run security app called Sanchar Saathi. The move came after protests from privacy groups and tech giants like Apple and Google, who said the app could be used for mass surveillance. The government now says the app is optional and can be removed, but the debate over privacy continues."
