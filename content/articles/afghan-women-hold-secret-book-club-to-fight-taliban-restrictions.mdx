title: "Afghan Women Hold Secret Book Club to Fight Taliban Restrictions"
summary: "Five Afghan women secretly meet every Thursday to read books like Orwell’s *Animal Farm* and stories about women’s struggles. The Taliban shut down schools for girls, so these women use reading to learn, share ideas and stay hopeful. They rotate meeting places, sometimes using phones and weak internet, to stay safe. The club gives them a voice, confidence, and a sense that knowledge can resist oppression."
