title: "India Confirms Two Nipah Virus Cases in West Bengal, Airports in Asia on High Alert"
summary: "India says it has found two people with Nipah virus in West Bengal. The health ministry tested about 200 close contacts and found no new cases, so the outbreak was contained. Nipah spreads from animals like bats and pigs and can kill 40‑75% of people because there’s no vaccine. Airports in Thailand, Nepal, Vietnam and others are screening travellers from India, but India says the surge stories are false."
