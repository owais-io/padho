title: "Harry Brook’s Fielding Keeps India on Edge"
summary: "England’s fielding has been a highlight of the Test series. Harry Brook made a great catch and kept the game lively, showing he’s a top fielder. The match was calm with no bad behaviour, despite a brief spat between Shubman Gill and an England bowler. England’s fielders stayed energetic and friendly, but some critics say India’s team were too passive on the field. The game shows that good fielding can shift the mood."
