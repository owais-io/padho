title: "Iran’s stubborn uranium program: national pride vs. US pressure"
summary: "Iran has kept enriching uranium because it sees it as a symbol of national independence and modernity. The idea began in the 1970s, and the country still thinks owning the technology protects it from the West. But the program has cost Iran huge sanctions, hurt its economy, and sparked endless talks with the US. Iran wants the enrichment to stay inside its borders, while the US demands limits on missiles and support for proxy groups."
