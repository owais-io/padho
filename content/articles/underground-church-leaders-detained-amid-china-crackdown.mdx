title: Underground church leaders detained amid China crackdown
summary: >-
  Chinese police detain leaders of an underground church as part of a crackdown
  on unregistered Christian groups. Early Rain Covenant Church’s head, Li
  Yingqiang, and several members were taken in Sichuan, while others remain
  missing. Authorities cite “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” as the
  offence, a blanket charge used against dissenters. The move follows earlier
  arrests of Zion Church members and a 100‑person sweep in Zhejiang.
  Human‑rights groups warn that China’s tighter controls threaten religious
  freedom.
