title: "Smuggled Starlink kits keep a few Iranians online during internet shutdowns"
summary: "After a nationwide internet blackout in Iran, a small number of people are still able to reach the world using smuggled Starlink satellite kits. Roughly 50‑100 000 of these devices are hidden in homes and apartments. They let users send photos, videos and messages, but the government treats Starlink as espionage and can jam or confiscate them. Officials may push a government‑run “national internet” that cuts Iran off from global sites."
