title: "Afghan Women Losing Medical Care"
summary: "The Taliban has stopped women from studying or working after primary school, leaving very few female doctors and nurses. Girls are being married off as young as 12 for money, worsening poverty. With no female medical staff, women cannot get treatment or talk to male doctors. The result is a dangerous lack of medical care for Afghan women, and the world has largely stayed quiet about it."
