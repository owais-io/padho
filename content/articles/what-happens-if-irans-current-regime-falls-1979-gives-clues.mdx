title: "What Happens if Iran’s Current Regime Falls? 1979 Gives Clues"
summary: "Iran is on the brink of major protests, driven by soaring inflation and anger over government repression. The US is pushing for a regime change, and if the current leaders are ousted, the country could face a chaotic transition, just as it did in 1979. History shows that while a broad coalition can topple a ruler, it often leaves a power vacuum that can lead to a new authoritarian regime."
