Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his readiness to face significant repercussions for resisting U.S. pressure on India’s trade policies. This defiance comes after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian exports as a punitive measure for India’s continued purchase of Russian oil. This new tariff is in addition to a previously announced 25% tariff, bringing the total to a hefty 50%. India’s foreign ministry has criticized the tariffs as ‘unfair, unjustified, and unreasonable,’ pointing out the double standards since other countries buying Russian oil haven't faced the same penalties.

In a speech, Modi stood firm, emphasizing that India would not compromise on the interests of its farmers, livestock rearers, and fisherfolk. The U.S. has been pushing India to accept imports of American genetically modified crops and duty-free imports of U.S. farm and dairy products. However, protecting the agricultural sector, which is a significant political force in India, remains a top priority for Modi’s government. Indian officials have stated that these issues are non-negotiable.

The tariffs have sparked criticism within India, with opposition leaders like Shashi Tharoor suggesting India impose similar tariffs on U.S. goods. The Congress party has condemned the U.S. strategy of using tariffs to coerce India into changing its trade and foreign policies. The opposition has also criticized the Modi government for its handling of the situation, claiming Modi is yielding to American influence.

Indian media, which previously celebrated the ‘special relationship’ between Modi and Trump, now reflect a shift in sentiment with strong anti-American views emerging. Editorials in major newspapers like The Hindu stress that India’s sovereignty is non-negotiable, and foreign policy should remain independent.

Experts note that the 50% tariffs will significantly impact Indian exports to the U.S., affecting sectors like textiles, auto-components, and steel. The economic repercussions could be substantial, placing India at a disadvantage compared to regional competitors. However, some experts suggest that India could respond by reducing its own tariffs to better integrate into global markets and explore new trade opportunities beyond the U.S.

As the U.S. remains India’s largest export market, the economic stakes are high. India’s strategic autonomy and trade policies are being tested, but the nation’s leadership seems resolved to maintain its course, emphasizing national interest and sovereignty.
