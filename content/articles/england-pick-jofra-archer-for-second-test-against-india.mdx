title: England pick Jofra Archer for second Test against India
summary: >-
  England have called fast bowler Jofra Archer into the squad for the second
  Test at Edgbaston, even though Sussex coach Paul Farbrace thinks he should
  wait for the third game. Archer is back after a successful debut for Sussex
  and will be the only change from the opening Test win. The selectors must
  decide whether to drop Chris Woakes or Josh Tongue to make room, and Archer’s
  injury‑heavy past makes the decision even trickier.
