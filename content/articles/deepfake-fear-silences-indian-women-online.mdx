title: Deepfake Fear Silences Indian Women Online
summary: >-
  Indian women fear AI deepfakes that turn their photos into fake nudity or
  sexual images. A report by the Rati Foundation shows that most such abuse
  targets women, making them stop posting online. Cases like singer Asha Bhosle
  and journalist Rana Ayyub illustrate the problem. Platforms often respond
  slowly, and laws are unclear, leaving victims with little help. The fear keeps
  ordinary women like Gaatha Sarvaiya silent.
