title: "Cloudburst Triggers Deadly Flood in Uttarakhand, India"
summary: "A rare heavy rain event called a cloudburst caused a deadly flood in Uttarakhand, India, killing at least four people and leaving 100 missing. Meteorologists say it happens when more than 100 mm of rain falls in a tiny area in a short time, often over mountains during monsoons. Moist air rises, forming huge clouds that burst, sometimes with glacier melt. Similar events killed thousands in 2013, and extreme rains are rising as the planet warms."
