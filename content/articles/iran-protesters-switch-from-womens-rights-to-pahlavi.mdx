title: "Iran Protesters Switch from Women’s Rights to Pahlavi"
summary: "In February, crowds in cities like Karaj shouted “death to the dictator” while younger protesters in Iran began chanting for a former king’s son, Reza Pahlavi, as a new hope. The slogans shifted from the 2022 “woman, life, freedom” rally to a more male‑driven message that also points to economic pain. About 30,000 people are said to have been killed by security forces. The violence and the new call for a monarchy threaten the theocratic regime’s survival."
