title: "India Women Forced to Watch Violent Content to Train AI"
summary: "Women in rural India sit in their homes, watching up to 800 violent or sexual videos a day to help train AI. The work keeps them employed, but it also leaves them numb, anxious, and unable to talk about it because of strict contracts. Researchers say the job is as dangerous as any hazardous job, yet most companies offer little help. These workers risk mental health damage for low pay and no legal protection."
