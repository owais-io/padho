title: 'Record Floods Devastate Punjab, Displacing Thousands'
summary: >-
  Record monsoon rains have flooded more than 1,400 villages in Punjab,
  Pakistan, washing out homes and forcing around 300,000 people to leave their
  houses. The floods are caused by rivers bursting their banks and huge dam
  releases from India. Residents face no water, electricity and food for days,
  and hospitals worry about cholera and snake bites. Local volunteers are
  stepping in while government response is slow.
