title: "Trump’s One-Month Roller‑Coaster of Demands on Iran"
summary: "Trump’s promises and threats about Iran kept changing over a month. He said Iran had to negotiate over its nuclear program, or face airstrikes, then later backed off. He blamed the Iranian protests for the regime’s violence, even while promising help. Trump tried to hit Iran with tariffs and moved a U.S. carrier group to the region, but never actually launched attacks. The U.S. stance was confusing and volatile."
