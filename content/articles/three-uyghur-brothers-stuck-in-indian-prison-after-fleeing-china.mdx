title: Three Uyghur brothers stuck in Indian prison after fleeing China
summary: >-
  On June 2013, three Uyghur brothers from Xinjiang crossed into India to escape
  Chinese repression. They were caught in Ladakh, tried for illegal entry, and
  sent to prison. After 18 months, instead of release, Indian authorities kept
  them in custody under a safety law, extending their stay for years. They now
  live in prisons in Haryana, suffer health problems, and rely on a lawyer who
  fights for their release. They face indefinite detention and risk being sent
  back to China.
