title: "India’s job guarantee could spark rural revolt if scrapped"
summary: "India’s long‑running MGNREGA, a job guarantee that gives rural adults a right to work or a wage, has created millions of jobs and helped women and marginalized groups. The Modi government is replacing it with a central welfare plan that limits funding and lets the state decide when to give work. Critics warn that this could leave poor farmers and women without jobs during bad rains, sparking protests and hurting the government’s reputation."
