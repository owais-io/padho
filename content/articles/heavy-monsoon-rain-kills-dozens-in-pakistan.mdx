summary: "Torrential monsoon rain hit Pakistan on Wednesday, killing at least 63 people.

Many people drowned, and others died when houses collapsed or they were electrocuted. The total death toll this year from monsoon floods is now almost 180, mostly children. Similar heavy rains caused flash floods in New York, New Jersey and a glacial‑lake burst in Nepal."
