title: 'Trump Claims Huge Oil Deal with Pakistan, But No Real Proof'
summary: >-
  Trump said the US and Pakistan would work on huge oil reserves, even promising
  a 19% tariff for Pakistan. But scientists and former oil execs say Pakistan
  has no proven big oil fields. Past searches by big firms found little, only
  small wells that produce 65,000 barrels a day. Pakistan is still opening new
  blocks for oil and gas, but security risks and lack of data make real profits
  unlikely.
