title: "China Sees Greenland as a Chance, Trump Opposes"
summary: "China sees Greenland as a way to weaken US‑led alliances, while US President Trump wants to take control. EU officials warn this will split NATO. Beijing enjoys the idea that U.S. unity will break down, but Chinese companies have struggled to invest in Greenland because of Danish and U.S. resistance. China still pushes a “Polar Silk Road” through the Arctic, hoping to use new shipping routes, but its presence there is small."
