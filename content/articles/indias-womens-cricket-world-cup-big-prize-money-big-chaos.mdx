title: "India’s Women’s Cricket World Cup: Big Prize Money, Big Chaos"
summary: "India’s Women’s Cricket World Cup just started, but the event is a mix of huge prize money and chaos. The $13.88 million pot beats even the men’s cup, showing how far the game has come. However, the ICC shuffled matches for security, moving a semi‑final and maybe the final, and Pakistan will play in Sri Lanka. England, under new coach Charlotte Edwards, must fight a tight schedule and a tough squad to reach the semis."
