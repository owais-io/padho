title: "India orders airlines to check Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash report"
summary: "India’s aviation regulator has told airlines to inspect the fuel‑switch locks on Boeing planes after a preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash showed the engines were starved of fuel seconds after take‑off. The report found no cause but raised questions about whether a pilot or a faulty switch cut the fuel. Airlines and South Korea are checking the locks, but no action has yet been taken against Boeing. Pilots’ associations warn against jumping to conclusions."
