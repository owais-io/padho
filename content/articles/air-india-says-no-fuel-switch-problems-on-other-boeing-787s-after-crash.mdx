title: Air India Says No Fuel Switch Problems on Other Boeing 787s After Crash
summary: >-
  Air India says it found no problems with the fuel switches on its other Boeing
  787 planes after the deadly crash that killed 260 people. The crash happened
  when the switches that feed fuel to the engines were accidentally turned off
  just after take‑off, causing the engines to fail. U.S. investigators are
  looking at what the captain did, while Air India says inspections on other
  planes were fine. Pilot groups say blame is premature.
