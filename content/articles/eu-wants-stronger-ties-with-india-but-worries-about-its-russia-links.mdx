title: EU wants stronger ties with India but worries about its Russia links
summary: >-
  EU wants to boost trade with India, but it’s uneasy because the Indian
  government has joined Russian military drills and buys discounted Russian oil.
  Brussels says it will keep pressuring Russia while still trying to sign a new
  trade deal with India before year‑end. The EU also warns it won’t accept a
  100% tariff that the US wants on Indian goods. Europe is working to cut
  Russian oil imports by 2028, and Poland wants to stop them by 2026.
