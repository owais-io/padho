title: "400 Children in Bangladesh Brothels Get Birth Certificates, Gaining Rights"
summary: "In Bangladesh’s Daulatdia brothel, 400 children who were never officially registered are now getting birth certificates. Campaigners, led by Freedom Fund, discovered a loophole in the law that allows births to be recorded without parents’ details. The certificates give kids school, passport and voting rights, and protect them from trafficking. Mothers now urge other women to register their babies, while activists say the documents are vital for safety and survival."
